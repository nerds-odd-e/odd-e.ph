			<em>"One of the toughest jobs he had was to be an agile ambassador to the other functional groups within the company. Although extremely frustrating at times, he would always help with repeated trainings, consultative calls, meetings, etc. to help bridge the gap between the development team, and the other groups that are still too used to doing things the old way."</em>
