  <h2>Course Summary</h2>
  <p>This one-day Stories to Specifications workshop covers effective practices that helps teams build the right product. While this is the domain of Product Owners or Product Managers, we have found that involving entire teams is more effective.</p>
  <p>The course is structure around a central activity, and we learn and apply the practices of Story Mapping, User Personas, User Stories, and Specification by Example to develop it. This course assumes that the participants have a good understanding of Scrum, as the course will relate the practices to Scrum and its events.</p>
  <p>The course is designed to be activity and discussion driven, with attendees forming groups of 4 people to learn these practices. Each course is maximum 16 participants, and we recommend that the entire Scrum Team, with the support teams attend together to have a shared understanding and experience building the right product.</p>
