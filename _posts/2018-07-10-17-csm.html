    <h3>Course Description</h3>
    <p>This two-day Certified ScrumMaster® course covers the what, how and especially the whys of the Scrum framework for product development -- the theory and guidance on how to practice. The course is structured around stories and discussions and is targeted to anyone who wants a deep understanding of Scrum. This includes team members, product owners, scrum masters and other stakeholders. Most of the course is given from the scrum master's perspective.</p>
    <p>The course is 2 days. The first day introduces us to why we want to deliver a product or service in small increments and how Scrum helps us do that using the product backlog. The second day leads us into how we work together to be able to deliver the most valuable product in small increments. Somewhere along, we shall expand our understanding to include common impacts to the larger organization when using Scrum.</p>
    <p>Having basic knowledge of Scrum is expected and some experience is preferred. At a minimum, suggested reading is the <a href="http://scrumguides.org">Scrum Guide.</a></p>
