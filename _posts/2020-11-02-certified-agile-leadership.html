    <h3>Course Description</h3>
    <p>As the world of work becomes increasingly complex, organizations and leaders are called upon to deliver more innovative products and services on a more frequent basis, while keeping the company’s culture dynamic and gratifying.</p>

    <p>CAL I is an introductory, educational course that consists of in depth leadership development learning objectives across five categories. The goal of CAL I is to bring awareness of agile leadership thinking, focus, and behaviors; and to start (or meet where they are) the agile leader on their learning journey. CAL I is your stepping stone to CAL II, which continues your journey with a deep dive into your leadership development practice and success.</p>

    <p>The Scrum Alliance Certified Agile Leadership (CAL) program (CAL I + CAL II) is a unique two-part education and practice-based program to develop agile leadership competency and maturity.</p>

    <p>Through the CAL program, you can increase your leadership effectiveness and learn how to be a better leader, no matter what your role.</p>

    <p>CAL participants vary by professional background and work experience. The common thread is their desire to enhance their workplaces (and their clients’ workplaces) with agile values, practices, and metrics. This program is for anyone leading or participating in an agile transformation.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Coach / Consultant</strong>. Your challenge is to help clients navigate an agile transformation with a focus on the people and mindsets necessary to shift the culture. A CAL certification provides you the tools to help enact change, and distinguishes you in the field as someone who has acquired the defined knowledge of an agile leader.</li>
      <li><strong>Manager.</strong> One of your challenges may be overcoming internal resistance to organization-wide agility. Certified Agile Leadership gives you practical tools to bolster your shift from agile practitioner to agile leader, and helps you nurture yourself and senior management champions to solidify your efforts.</li>
      <li><strong>Executive.</strong> Finding the time to nurture your own agility and discovering a meaningful role to play in an agile transformation is challenging. You desire to be more than just someone who authorizes hiring a consultant or coach. Certified Agile Leadership certification can quickly accelerate your learning curve and show you the active role you could play in a sustainable agile transformation. You’ll also discover a personal transformation as you learn about your own internal leadership development.</li>
      <li><strong>The Leader in You… In All of Us.</strong> Finding out more about your personal leadership style can enlighten you and help you be more empathetic to everyone you encounter. This program can enhance both your career and your personal life.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This course covers CAL I.  We plan to have a separate CAL II session later this year.</p>
