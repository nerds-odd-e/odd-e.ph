    <h3>Course Description</h3>
    <p>This three half-day Certified ScrumMaster® course covers the<strong> what, how, and especially the whys</strong> of the Scrum framework for product development--the theory and guidance on how to practice Scrum well.</p>

    <p>The course is structured around <strong>stories and discussions</strong>, and is targeted to anyone who wants a <strong>deep understanding of Scrum</strong>.  This includes Development Team members, Product Owners, Scrum Masters, and other stakeholders.  Most of the course is given from the <strong>Scrum Master's perspective</strong>.</p>

    <p>The course introduces us to <strong>why we want to deliver a product or service in small increments</strong> and how Scrum helps us do that.  This then leads us into <strong>how we work together to be able to deliver the most valuable product in small increments</strong>.  Throughout the course we shall expand our understanding to include <strong>common impacts to the larger organization</strong> when using Scrum.</p>

    <p>Having basic knowledge of Scrum is expected and some experience is preferred.  At a minimum, suggested reading is the <a href="https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html">Scrum Guide</a>.</p>
