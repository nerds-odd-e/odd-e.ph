    <h3>Course Description</h3>
    <p>
      Agile software development has become the most desirable way to achieve a "successful" project outcome. Rumours abound of receiving more output with the same "resources" by delivering using agile. This approach is being applied to client-vendor software engagements with the same expectation of more for less. Client-vendor arrangements tend to be more challenging but if you understand the concepts underlying an agile approach you'll be better prepared for the journey.
    </p>
    <p>So what does taking an agile approach actually involve and why?</p>
    <p>Scrum is the most popular agile approach in use today and this two-day Certified Scrum Product Owner&reg; course provides an introduction, covering the what, how and especially the whys of using Scrum for product development; the theory as well as guidance on how to practice.</p>
    <p>The course is structured around stories, group activities and dialogue and is suitable for anyone who wants a deep understanding of Scrum. This includes team members, product owners, scrum masters, business analyists, project managers, senior managers, functional managers, users and other stakeholders. The course is tailored towards the client's perspective of a client-vendor relationship.</p>
    <p>The course is 2 days. The first day introduces us to the reasons why we want to deliver a product or service in small increments and how Scrum helps us do that using the product backlog. The second day leads us into how we work together to be able to deliver the most valuable product in small increments. Somewhere along, we will also expand our understanding to include common impacts to both client and vendor when using Scrum as well as implications for budgeting, contracts and other factors commonly not considered when making a decision to "go agile".</p>
    <p>Having basic knowledge of Scrum is expected and some experience is preferred. At a minimum, suggested reading is the <a href="http://scrumguides.org">Scrum Guide.</a></p>
