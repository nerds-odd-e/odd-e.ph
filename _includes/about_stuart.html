Stuart recognizes the very survival of many organisations depends upon their ability to maintain adaptable and affordable software systems. An understanding of how this is possible, and how to transform organisations into self managing teams to accomplish it, is a particular focus for him. He has been a proponent of XP practices since 2001, when his best friend lent him a copy of 'Extreme Programming Explained'. More than a decade later, and with the experience of working in and helping transform teams and organisations, he continues to learn and to help others learn how to achieve their own goals.

<p>Stuart's interest in understanding how people, teams and organisation work goes back a long way. He read Deming's 'Out of the Crisis' around 1990 and has spent much of the rest of his life learning and experiencing how to consciously improve practices and focus on what's important, not just what can be measured. His objective remains constant: to delight his clients, by helping them be able to delight their own.</p>
