	<h2>Agile Coaching</h2>
	<p>
		Agile Coaching means that an experienced Agile Coach will work closely together with an organization to improve its product development agility. Agility is a broad term used for the flexibility in product development-- the ability to respond to changes. This flexibility is achieved by shortening feedback loops and focus on improved quality. This faster feedback cycle might also leads to other benefits such as higher productivity.
	</p>
	<p>Odd-e Philippines cover a broad range of Agile Coaching categories. Among them: Organizational Coaching, Team or Scrum Coaching, and Technical Practices Coaching.

	<h2>Product Development and Software Engineering</h2>
  <p>
		Deep down, we are software developers, programmers, and hardcore software craftsmen. We would jump at opportunities where we can fire up our coding tools and start working that keyboard.
	</p>
	<p>Organizations can tap on our skills and experience to build their product for/along with them. We will work in the iterative and incremental manner as we preach. We shall employ all the better software engineering practices we train with. We shall mentor the other development team members we work with.
